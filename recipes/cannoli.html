      <h5>Ingredients</h5>
      <ul id="ingredients">
        <p>For the Ricotta Cream</p>
        <li>2 lb. whole or part skim milk ricotta</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup confectioners sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 oz. semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon chopped candied orange peel</li>

        <p>For the shells</p>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour, plus more as need</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>About 1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 egg white, beaten</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Candied cherries or candied orange peel (optional)</li>
        <li>Confectioners sugar</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Directions</h5>
      <ul id="ingredients">
        <li>Line a large strainer white cheesecloth.</li>
        <li> Place the strainer over a bowl. Scrape the ricotta into
        the strainer and cover with a piece of plastic wrap and a small plate.</li>
        <li> Weight the plate with a heavy can.</li>
        <li>Let the ricotta drain in the refrigerator for several hours, or overnight.</li>

        <p> To make the shells:</p>
        <li>In the large bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, cinnamon,and salt.>/li>
        <li>Stir in the oil and enough wine to make a soft dough. </li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it until smooth and well blended, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a ball.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for at least 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 4 pieces. Starting at the middle setting, run one of the pieces of dough through the roller of a pasta machine.</li>
        <li>Lightly dust the dough with flour as needed to keep the pieces from sticking.</li>
        <li>Continue to pass the dough through the machine until you reach the last or second to the last setting. </li>
        <li>The dough strip should be about 4 inches wide and thin enough to see your hand through.(The dough can be rolled on a board with a rolling pin,
           but be sure to roll it very thin.)</li>
        <li>Measure the length of your cannoli tubes and cut the strip of dough crosswise into pieces about 1 inch shorter.</li>
        <li>Continue rolling out the remaining dough. </li>
        <li>If you do not have enough cannoli tubes for all of the dough, lay the pieces of dough on sheets of plastic wrap and keep them cover until you are ready to use.</li>
        <li>Oil the cannoli tubes. </li>
        <li>Place a cannoli tube on one piece of dough at an angle, from corner to corner.</li>
        <li>Fold the two other corners of the dough around the tube, being careful not to stretch the dough or pull it tightly. </li>
        <li>Dab a little egg white on the dough where the edges overlap, avoid getting egg white on the tube, or the cannoli will stick to it.</li>
        <li>Press the overlap to seal. </li>
        <li>Repeat with the reaming dough. </li>
        <li>Pour 2 inches of oil into a deep fryer or deep heavy saucepan.</li>
        <li>Heat to 375 f. on a deep-frying thermometer.</li>
        <li> Line a baking pan with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Carefully lower a few of cannoli tubes into the hot oil. Do not crowd the pan.</li>
        <li>Fry the shells until golden, about 2 minutes, turning them so that they brown evenly.</li>
        <li>With tongs, remove the cannoli tubes, holding them straight up so that oil flows back into the pan.</li>
        <li> Drain the tubes briefly on the paper towels. </li>
        <li> While the are still hot, carefully slide the cannoli shells from the tubes.</li>
        <li> Grasp each tube with a pot holder and pull the cannoli shell off the tube with a pair of tongs, or with you hand protected
        by an oven mitt or towel.</li>
        <li>Cool the shells completely on the paper towels.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining container I dough. ( If you are reusing the cannoli tubes, let them cool before wrapping
        them in the dough.)</li>
        <li>Set aside. ( The cannoli shell can be made up 2 days before serving. Store in sealed in a cool, dry place.)</li>

        <p> To make the ricotta cream:<p>
        <li>  Put the ricotta in a food processor and bland it until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon and bled until smooth. </li>
        <li>Transfer to a bowl and stir in the chocolateand the candied fruit, if using. ( The filling can be made up 24 hours before serving. Store and refrigerate.)</li>
        <p> To assemble:</P>
        <li>and cream. </li>
        <li>If desired, decorate the ends with candied cherry or strips of orange peel.</li>
        <li>Place the cannoli on a serving platter and sprinkle with confectioners’ sugar. </li>
        <li>Serve within 1 hour.</li>
